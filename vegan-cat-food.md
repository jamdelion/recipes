# Vegan Cat Food

> Makes 4 or 5 batches of seitan chunks.

> Each batch is about a week's worth of supplementary food for two cats. (See the note below for how I feed my cats).

Time: 
20 min prep | 40 min cook

## Ingredients

### For the seitan chunks (makes about 750g):

- Vital wheat gluten | 165g / 1 cup (optional: sub in some chickpea flour, see below)
- Nutritional yeast | 15g / 1/4 cup 
- Chickpea flour | sub in place of some gluten (optional)
- Water | 180g / 3/4 cup


### For the wet cat food:

- Seitan chunks | 185g
- Nutritional yeast | 25g
- Olive oil | 13.5g
- [Vegecat powder](https://compassioncircle.com/product/vegecat-17-6-oz-for-adult-cats/) | 7.5g
- Cold pressed flax seed oil | (optional) 3g

## Method

1. First make the seitan chunks: mix the dry ingredients together.
2. Add the water then knead for 1 minute.
3. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.
4. Knead for 1 minute.
5. Cut into rough chunks.
> [!TIP]
> I've found the easiest way to cut into chunks is using scissors - hack small pieces off directly over a pot of water.
> 
> It can help to make the scissor blades wet too.
7. Simmer the chunks in a large pot of water over heat for 40 minutes.
8. Remove the chunks and wait until cooled.
9. Chop the chunks roughly into tiny pieces, or put in a blender to achieve the same.
10. Separate the blended chunks into portions of 185g each and freeze all but one.
11. Move on to making the wet cat food with the last 185g portion.
12. In a clean bowl, mix the nutritional yeast and the vegecat powder together. 
13. Add the blended seitan chunks.
14. Add the olive oil and flax seed oil if using.
15. Mix well, then transfer to a clean jar and put in the fridge for serving.

## A note about our cats:
We usually feed our cats a teaspoon of vegan cat food alongside a teaspoon of non-vegan meat per meal (x3 per day). 

Whilst we are a vegan household, and extremely skeptical of the pet food industry, we also aren't sure enough about the safety of an all-vegan diet for cats to go full vegan with them. So we have settled for reducing their meat consumption and feeding them vegan [Amicat biscuits](www.veggiepets.com/vegan-cat-food/ami-vegan-cat-food-1-5kg), conventional meat cat food, and this homemade wet food (which one of them loves, the other one tolerates).
